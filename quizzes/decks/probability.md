##Define probability

-

The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.

--

##Describe the law of large numbers

-

As more observations are collected, the proportion of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to the probability p of that outcome.

--

##Define the concept of mutually exclusive (disjoint) events

-

Two outcomes are called disjoint or mutually exclusive if the cannot both happen, for instance, getting 1 and 2 when rolling a die.

--

##Define the addition rule for disjoint outcomes

-

$$P(A \; or \; B) = P(A) + P(B)$$

--

##Define the concept of event

-

An event represents a collection of outcomes, for example, the event of getting 1 or 2 when rolling a die can be defined as A = {1,2}

--

##Define the concept of disjoint events

-

Two events are disjoint when they don't have elements in common, for example:

$$A = \\{ 1,2 \\}$$
$$B = \\{ 4,5,6 \\}$$

--

##Define the general addition rule

-

$$P(A \; or \; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \; and \; B)$$

--


##Define probability distribution

-

A probability distribution is a table of all disjoint outcomes and their associated probabilities.

--

##Define sample space

-

Sample space is the set of all possible outcomes in an experiment.

--

##Define complement

-

The complement of event A is denoted A^c and represents all outcomes not included in A.

--

##Describe the mathematical relation between event A and its complement

-


$$P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$$ 

--

##Define independence

-

Two process are independent if knowing the outcome of one provides no useful information about the outcome of the other. For instance, flipping a coin and rolling a die are two independent processes, knowing the coins was heads does not help to determine the outcome of a die roll. On the other hand, stock prices usually move up or down together, so they are not independent.

--

#Define the multiplication rule for independent processes

-

If A and B are independent.

$$P(A \; and \; B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$
